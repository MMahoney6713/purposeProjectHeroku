# On Purpose - a Springboard Software Engineering Capstone Project

See the app (may take a minute on first load): https://life-on-purpose.herokuapp.com

## Description

In "On Purpose," you create your "personal mission" that defines where you want your life to end up. This characterizes the life that you want to lead, the character traits you want to embody, and the impact that you want to have on those around you. As personal missions are refined, missional goals are added along with milestones on an interactive calendar to act as markers along the trail on your journey towards fulfilling your personal missions. 

For this project, I focused on learning a new back-end framework - Django. With extensive Flask/Python experience, I wanted to build a web app from scratch using Django to better understand some of the differences that exist between the two frameworks. 


## Technologies used
- Django / Django-Allauth
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript / JQuery / Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku

## Development Roadmap
- A "Profile" section, to allow users to update their account information
- Connect Goals with Milestones, and add color-coding to show milestone/goal connections on calendar
- OAuth connectivity with other major Social platforms (Facebook, Twitter)
