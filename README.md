# On Purpose - a Springboard Software Engineering Capstone Project

Heroku Deployment: https://life-on-purpose.herokuapp.com

In "On Purpose," you can create mission statements that define where you want your life to end up. You then create goals and milestones on a calendar to help you keep going on the progress to your life mission. 

For this project, I focused on learning a new back-end framework - Django. With extensive Flask/Python experience, I wanted to build a web app from scratch using Django to better understand some of the differences that exist between the two frameworks. 


# Technologies used
- Django / Django-Allauth
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript / JQuery / Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku

# Development Roadmap
- A "Profile" section, to allow users to update their account information
- Connect Goals with Milestones, and add color-coding to show milestone/goal connections on calendar
- OAuth connectivity with other major Social platforms (Facebook, Twitter)
