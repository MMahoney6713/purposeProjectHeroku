In "On Purpose," you can create mission statements that define where you want your life to end up. You then create goals and milestones on a calendar to help you keep going on the progress to your life mission. 

For this project, I focused on learning a new back-end framework - Django. With extensive Flask/Python experience, I wanted to build a web app from scratch using Django to better understand some of the differences that exist between the two frameworks.
